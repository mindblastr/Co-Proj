# Co-Proj

Files for a project that was supposed to run on a Dilligent Zybo FPGA board, to run a trained NN on a set of images with numbers and identify the numbers.

It's mostly undocummented, but if anyone finds anything decent here, they are free to use it. 

Most of the project was done using Vivado.
